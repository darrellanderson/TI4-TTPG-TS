Many numpad keys are useful. If you need a reminder right click the table to view help. Here's a quick overview:

1: spawn a tradegood.

2: spawn a fighter token.

3: spawn an infantry token.

5: look at the active system.

6: look at the map.

7: look at the scoring area.

9: look at my player area.

0: throw any held items into the trash. Because this one has serious consequences you need to follow the given instructions to turn it on.

If you are playing on a computer without a numpad, you can use keybindings in settings to use whatever keys you like.

4 and 8 are available for future use.
