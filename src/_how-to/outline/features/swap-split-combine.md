The "r" key does several things: Swap, Split, and Combine.

Swap: Hover over an infantry or fighter and press 'r' to swap it between plastic and a cardboard token.

Split: Hover over a x3 token, 'r' will split it into 3 x1 tokens.

Combine: Drag to select multiple tokens and press 'r' to join them from x1 to x3 versions.
