During the agenda phase place the current agenda in the reserved spot to open the agenda window, giving players buttons to play or skip "when an agenda is revealed" and "after an agenda is revealed" options. If any player chooses to play one of those options, it resets anyone who skipped with the option to try again.

After an outcome type is selected, you can right click a rider to assign the predicted outcome. The rider will appear next to that choice, players can click it to view the full card text.

If an agenda is secret, place the agenda card face down on the spot.
