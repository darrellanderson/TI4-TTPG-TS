During the status phase players score objectives.

Right click a public objective to place your control token on it and advance your scoring token.

Similarly, right click a secret objective to score. You need to right click the card itself, not the version that pops up in your hand at the bottom of the screen.

Do not place control tokens on cards in scoring holders; doing so prevents the scoring holder from organizing cards properly.

If there's a need to make a secret objective public, place it in the "extra" slot of one of the objectives mats. It will then score like a public objective.
