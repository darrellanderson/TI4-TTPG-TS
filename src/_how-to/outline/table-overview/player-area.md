Let's take a look at a player area.

The "status pad" has buttons to pass or eliminate. Eliminate only skips that player's turns, players still need to manage the elimination cleanup. You can also click a player's name in the turn order list to pass or eliminate them.

Each player gets two "trove" mats, an ideal place to drop their strategy card or any cards for sale such as promissory notes or relic fragments.

The "build area" counts the cost of units and resources of planet cards and tradegoods placed inside it. Right click to move units to home or the last active system.

The "planet card" mat includes right click options to fetch planet cards from the last activeated system.

The "technology card" mat helps organize techs.

Finally the "card holder" is your hand. When you unpack a faction it also gets relevant cards like your home planets and what not.
