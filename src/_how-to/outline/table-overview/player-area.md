Let's take a look at player areas.

The "status pad" has buttons to pass or eliminate. Eliminate only skips that player's turns, players still need to manage the elimination cleanup. You can also click a player's name in the turn order list to pass or eliminate them.

Each player gets two "trove" mats, an ideal place to drop their strategy card or any cards for sale such as promissory notes or relic fragments.

The "build area" counts the cost of produced units and consumed resources of planet cards and tradegoods placed inside it. Right click to move units to home or the last active system.

The "planet card" mat includes right click options to fetch planet cards from the last activated system.

The "technology card" mat helps organize techs.

Finally the "card holder" is your hand. When you unpack a faction it also gets relevant cards like your home planets and starting tech.

Notice the player areas at the top of the table are flipped, with content having the same orientation on both sides of the table; players don't need to rotate their camera around when moving between a player area and the rest of the table.

Unit boxes and a private purple garbage box. Dropping items in the garbage moves them to a discard pile or back to whereever they belong. Trashing a secret objective returns it to the secrets deck and shuffles it.
