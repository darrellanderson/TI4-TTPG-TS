Many games will start with the map tool. Right click the table to open it.

You can choose to select a premade map from a list already filtered down to the chosen player count. When you select a map it copies the string to the map tool, you still need to click "load map" to set it up.

Alternatively you can paste in your own map string, check Board Game Geek for many options.

Once the map is present, the map tool can place planet cards and frontier tokens.

If you prefer to start with a slice draft, click that option.

Choose your draft options, let's use a nucleus draft with extra faction choices.

Starting a draft opens a draft window for all players.

Click the zoom button to view larger versions of slices or the full map, click the zoomed version to close it.

When the draft factions include Keleres, it offers the three flavors. If a flavor is also present in the draft the Keleres option gets disabled when the flavor gets picked, if it was the current Keleres choice it gets shifted to a different one.

When you finish the draft it builds the map, reseats players, and sets the turn order. Unpack your faction by right clicking the faction reference card near your player area and select unpack.
