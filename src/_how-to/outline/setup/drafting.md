Start a game with a slice and faction draft by right clicking the table and opening the map tool, then select the slice draft option and your preferred draft type.

Click the zoom button to view larger versions of slices or the full map, click the zoomed version to close it.

When the draft factions include Keleres, it offers the three flavors. If a flavor is also present in the draft the Keleres option gets disabled when the flavor gets picked, if it was the current Keleres choice it gets shifted to a different one.

After finishing the draft it builds the map, reseats players, and sets the player order. Unpack your faction by right clicking the faction reference card near your player area and select unpack.
