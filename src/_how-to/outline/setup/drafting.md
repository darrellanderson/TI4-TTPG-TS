Start a game with a slice/faction draft by right clicking the table and opening the map tool, then select the slice draft option and your preferred draft type.

When the draft factions include Keleres, it offers the three flavors. If a flavor is also present in the draft the Keleres option gets disabled when the flavor gets picked, if it was the current Keleres choice it gets shifted to a different one.

After finishing the draft it builds the map and sets the player order. Unpack your faction by right clicking the faction reference card near your player area and select unpack.
