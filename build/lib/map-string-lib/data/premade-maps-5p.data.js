        comments: "I was going for an asymmetrical, almost 4 v 1 but not quite scenario. The Emperor has the strongest position with easy access to MR, 2 legendaries that produce GF, and a blue skip all in an easily defensible position. They are hindered however in the fact that they cannot score victory points without expanding which puts a lot of pressure on the other players to contain  them.   Each other slice has a wormhole with easy resources, a couple of tech skips, and a wormhole to trade. The excess should make VP's easy to score.   The Duke can score an easy 4 planet type point, but his tech skips being in danger make for a tenuous relation with the others.   The Bishop likewise suffers from proximity to the Emperor but is an a thankfully more guarded position. His RY techs might prove the difference in an all out war.   The Prince has the richest slice, and his 2 green skips allow for a potential counter to the Emperor's ground game. But who is willing to trade one tyrant for another?  The Countess's slice largely reflects the Emperor's and a BR tech path opens up options for a lot of factions. Efficient planets with lots of CC's could open up a lot of doors for potential plays.   The problem remains, with only 1 person able to claim the throne, can they work together to stop the looming threat?",
