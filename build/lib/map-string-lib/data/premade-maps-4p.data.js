        comments: "Lore-Inspired Scenario: thinking they would find a paradise world, the Creuss foolishly opened the gate to Ixth and woke the Mahact. As the Mahact fire up their ancient machines, a desperate contest is about to take place. The machines on Acheron tear space itself and a terrible new threat, the Vuil'raith emerge. The Argent scramble to fulfil their oaths as sacred guardians. Mahact prepares to propel Ixth back towards the center of the galaxy. The Creuss try to find a way to undo the ruin they've just unleashed, and prevent the Prophecy of Kings.  (Thematic note: in this scenario, points do not represent the will of the council, but progress with the understanding and use of the Acheron gates.)  Special Rules: Each player chooses one of the following races: Vuil'raith, Argent, Mahact, and Creuss. The races' starting locations can not be moved.  Mahact starts with the speaker token.  Remove the Trade and Warfare strategy cards from the game; they can never be chosen. Players will choose only one strategy card in the strategy phase.  Because there is no custodians token on this map, there will be no agenda phase. Any action card or secret objective that can only be used in the agenda phase gains the text 'ACTION: Discard this card to refresh your commodities.' (Note that this will allow Vuil'raith to use their agent.)  The first player to 8 points is the victor.",

Each slice has a tech skip and a few planets to get started but resources are scarce and border diputes will be inevitable without shrewd negotiation. The wormholes allow for easy neighbors and easier rivals. Equidistants have a tech specialty and lucrative systems making them very valuable. ",
