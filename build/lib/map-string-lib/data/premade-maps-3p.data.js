        comments: "This map was designed with an eye for balance whilst mimicking the 6 player layout, but with the primary goal to have as few planets in the central ring as possible and to place the legendary planets in the equidistants.  Conflict is encouraged with the majority of control objectives requiring players to enter opponents slices. The additional tiles in the central ring made accounting for all objectives far easier and prevents PDS2 breaking the game. All objectives should be scorable but being 3 player you always need a little flexibility with certain objectives.",

        comments: "Before play begins, place 'Mirage' on the '77' Tile and purge the Mirage exploration card from the Frontier deck. All the legendary planets should be available and equidistant.   Each players starts off with a small slice but many opportunities to expand. Each player is presented 4 avenues, 2 to Mecatol Rex, and 2 to a legendary planet. Dividing each section is empty space or an anomaly separating each area of the map into a field rather than a slice. This map features asymmetrical warp zones on the outer ring and lots of chokepoints, but multiple avenues of attack. The center is interconnected and of very high value, making for a maelstrom of conflict around Mecatol Rex. ",
